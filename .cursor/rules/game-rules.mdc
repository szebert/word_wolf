## How to Play

If someone is playing **"Word Wolf"** for the first time, one person should read these rules aloud.

The game proceeds in this order:\
**"Word Assignment" → "Discussion" → "Voting"**

---

### ① Word Assignment

- Each player secretly receives a **word**.
- Do not show your word to anyone.
- There are only two words in play: One that belongs to the majority (**Citizens**), and one that belongs to the minority (**Wolves**).
- You won’t know if you're a Citizen or a Wolf.

---

### ② Discussion

- Players talk and try to figure out **"Who is the Wolf?"**
- Everyone should speak as if they share the same word, even if unsure.
- You can subtly mislead or be vague to protect yourself and your team, but be careful!

---

### ③ Voting

- After discussion, players simultaneously point to who they think is a Wolf, saying **"Ready, go!"**
- The player with the most votes is eliminated.
- If there’s a tie, play a **Sudden Death** round:
  - You have 1 additional minute to discuss, then vote again. 
  - Repeat until someone is eliminated.

#### How to Win:

- **Citizens win** if they vote out a Wolf.

- **Wolves win** if a Citizen is voted out.

- **Wolf's Revenge:** If a Wolf is voted out but correctly guesses the Citizens' word, the Wolves steal the win!
